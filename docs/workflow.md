\# Bulk RNA-seq Workflow Summary



This repository follows a staged bulk RNA-seq analysis workflow:



1\. Alignment and quantification using nf-core/rnaseq

2\. Quality control and count matrix generation

3\. Differential expression analysis using DESeq2

4\. Pathway enrichment analysis (GSEA, ORA)

5\. Visualization and reporting



Detailed methodological rationale is provided in METHODS.md.
