# 🧪 Methods Appendix: Bulk RNA-seq Workflows

---

## Overview

This document describes the bulk RNA-sequencing analysis workflows used
for read alignment, gene expression quantification, quality control,
differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and visualization.
The workflows are presented in a methods-appendix style, emphasizing
clarity, reproducibility, and the rationale behind analytical decisions
rather than providing a turnkey software package.

## 1. High-Performance Computing Environment

All analyses were conducted on a high-performance computing (HPC)
cluster using a parallel file system optimized for shared data access.
Long-running pipelines were executed within persistent terminal
sessions to ensure uninterrupted processing across user
disconnections. Containerized software environments and SLURM-based job
scheduling were used throughout to promote reproducibility, scalability,
and consistent resource management.

## 2. Read Alignment and Expression Quantification

Bulk RNA-seq reads were processed using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline.
Sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm39)
using the splice-aware aligner STAR, and gene- and transcript-level
expression was quantified with RSEM. Sample metadata were supplied via
a structured samplesheet specifying sample identifiers, FASTQ file
paths, experimental conditions, and biological replicates. Reference
genome FASTA and gene annotation GTF files were provided explicitly to
ensure consistency across analyses. Quality control metrics from
preprocessing, alignment, and quantification were summarized using
MultiQC.

## 3. Count Matrix Generation and Quality Control

Gene-level count matrices generated by RSEM were merged across samples
and served as the primary input for downstream analyses. Quality
control reports were reviewed to evaluate read quality, alignment
performance, library complexity, and overall consistency across
samples. At this stage, count matrices were retained without additional
filtering to preserve flexibility for downstream statistical modeling.

## 4. Differential Expression Analysis

Differential gene expression analysis was performed using a
DESeq2-based statistical framework implemented through a standardized
analysis pipeline. Experimental comparisons were defined explicitly
using a contrast table specifying reference and target conditions.
Filtering thresholds based on minimum abundance, minimum sample
proportion, and fold change were applied to enhance robustness, while
unfiltered result tables were retained for comprehensive reporting and
interpretation. Differential expression results formed the basis for
downstream pathway analyses and visualization.

## 5. Pathway Enrichment Analyses

Pathway-level interpretation of transcriptional changes was performed
using both gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and over-representation
analysis (ORA). Curated gene sets from MSigDB, including Hallmark
pathways and Gene Ontology Biological Process categories, were used to
identify enriched biological processes associated with differential
expression signatures. Pathway–gene network analyses were additionally
employed to visualize relationships between enriched pathways and their
contributing genes.

## 6. Dimensionality Reduction and Exploratory Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to normalized gene
expression data using centered and scaled inputs. PCA was used to
explore global sample relationships, assess condition-driven variation,
and identify potential outliers. Multiple principal component
combinations were examined to support exploratory interpretation and
data quality assessment.

---

## 7. Visualization and Reporting

Visualization outputs included principal component analysis (PCA) plots,
enhanced volcano plots highlighting differentially expressed genes, and
complex heatmaps with annotated sample- and gene-level information.
Visualizations were generated using R-based tools and designed to
support both exploratory data assessment and biological interpretation,
with careful attention to clarity, consistency, and interpretability.
Gene-level result tables were annotated with standardized gene symbols
and gene classifications prior to reporting, and all final outputs were
exported in spreadsheet-compatible formats to facilitate downstream
review, presentation, and collaborative analysis.

## Notes on Reproducibility

All reference versions, file paths, and pipeline configurations are
documented for transparency. Raw FASTQ files and sensitive metadata are
intentionally excluded from this repository. Scripts reflect real
analysis workflows and may require adaptation to specific datasets or
computing environments.
