# 🧪 Methods Appendix: Bulk RNA-seq Workflows

---

## Overview

This document describes the **bulk RNA-sequencing analysis workflows**
used for read alignment, gene expression quantification, quality control,
differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and visualization.

The workflows are presented in a **methods-appendix style**, emphasizing
clarity, reproducibility, and the reasoning behind analytical decisions,
rather than providing a turnkey software package.

---

## 1️⃣ High-Performance Computing Environment

All analyses were conducted on a **high-performance computing (HPC)
cluster** using a parallel file system optimized for shared data access.
Long-running pipelines were executed within persistent terminal sessions
to ensure uninterrupted processing across user disconnections.

Containerized software environments and **SLURM-based job scheduling**
were used throughout to promote reproducibility, scalability, and
consistent resource management.

---

## 2️⃣ Read Alignment and Expression Quantification

Bulk RNA-seq reads were processed using the **nf-core/rnaseq pipeline**.
Sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm39)
using the splice-aware aligner **STAR**, and gene- and transcript-level
expression was quantified with **RSEM**.

Sample metadata were supplied via a structured samplesheet specifying
sample identifiers, FASTQ file paths, experimental conditions, and
biological replicates. Reference genome FASTA and gene annotation GTF
files were provided explicitly to ensure consistency across analyses.
Quality control metrics from preprocessing, alignment, and
quantification were summarized using **MultiQC**.

---

## 3️⃣ Count Matrix Generation and Quality Control

Gene-level count matrices generated by RSEM were merged across samples
and served as the primary input for downstream analyses. Quality control
reports were reviewed to evaluate read quality, alignment performance,
library complexity, and consistency between samples.

At this stage, count matrices were retained without additional filtering
to preserve flexibility for downstream statistical modeling.

## 4️⃣ Differential Expression Analysis

Differential gene expression analysis was performed using a
**DESeq2-based statistical framework** implemented through a
standardized analysis pipeline. Experimental comparisons were defined
explicitly using a contrast table specifying reference and target
conditions.

Filtering thresholds based on minimum abundance, minimum sample
proportion, and fold change were applied to enhance robustness, while
unfiltered result tables were retained for comprehensive reporting and
interpretation. Differential expression results formed the basis for
downstream pathway analyses and visualization.

---

## 5️⃣ Pathway Enrichment Analyses

To interpret transcriptional changes at the pathway level, both
**gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)** and
**over-representation analysis (ORA)** were performed.

Curated gene sets from **MSigDB**, including Hallmark pathways and Gene
Ontology Biological Process categories, were used to identify enriched
biological processes. Pathway–gene network analyses were additionally
employed to visualize relationships between enriched pathways and their
contributing genes.

---

## 6️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction and Exploratory Analysis

**Principal component analysis (PCA)** was applied to normalized gene
expression data using centered and scaled inputs. PCA was used to
explore global sample relationships, assess condition-driven variation,
and identify potential outliers.

Multiple principal component combinations were examined to support
exploratory interpretation and data quality assessment.

---

## 7️⃣ Visualization and Reporting

Visualization outputs included:

- Principal component analysis plots  
- Enhanced volcano plots highlighting significantly regulated genes  
- Complex heatmaps with annotated sample- and gene-level information  

Visualizations were generated using R-based tools and formatted to
balance clarity with biological interpretability. Gene-level result
tables were annotated with gene symbols and gene types prior to
reporting, and final outputs were exported in
spreadsheet-compatible formats for downstream review.

## 🔒 Notes on Reproducibility

All reference versions, file paths, and pipeline configurations are
documented for transparency. Raw FASTQ files and sensitive metadata are
intentionally excluded from this repository. Scripts reflect real
analysis workflows and may require adaptation to specific datasets or
computing environments.
