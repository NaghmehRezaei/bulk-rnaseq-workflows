# bulk-rnaseq-workflows

📄 **Full analytical methods are documented in [`METHODS.md`](METHODS.md).**

This repository documents bulk RNA-seq analysis workflows using nf-core
pipelines and downstream R-based analyses. The repository is written in
a methods-appendix style and reflects real analysis pipelines used in
research settings.

The focus of this repository is methodological transparency and
reproducibility rather than providing a turnkey software package.
